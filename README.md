# ðŸ¤” What this is
This github repo is a collection and backup of all our code for the NERC robotics competition. It also contains a catalog for all tested and future ideas.

# ðŸ’¡ How it works
- All ideas (wheather they have been implemente in code or not) for  ways to complete the entire race track are named as I1, I2, I3, I4, etc
- Implemented ideas have their code uploaded above and each new version is saved such that older versions can be viewed at any time.

# Abbreviations used
- All segments of the entire track have been labelled from A to F as shown in the diagram with the red text
- All corners are named by the two segments they goin as shown in the diagram with the green text


# I1 (Implemented)
**Description**: Fully hardcoded route

**Best time**: 

**Known Issues**
- Terribily inconsistent with turns
  

# I2 (Implemented)
**Description**: Full Gyro route w/ front sonar for timing AB, BC and CD turns

**Best time**: approx. 12 seconds

**Known Issues**
- Occasionally early turning @ B and C segment (possibily due to using sonar instead of ir)
- Highly inconsistent horizontal positioning @ C segment
